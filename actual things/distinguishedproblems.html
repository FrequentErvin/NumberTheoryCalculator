 Let $a,b$ be two positive integers with $d=GCD(a,b)$, then there must exist integers $x,y$ such that $ax+by=d$. Proof:
 Let $a=d*a'$ and $b=d*b'$. Inserting into the wanted equation we would like to find $x,y$ such that $a'x+b'y=1$ Now change the labelling (switch a' with a and b' with b). Notice that this is equivalent to $ax=1-by$. Looking at divisibility this is equivalent to proving the existence  an integer $x$ such that for any pair of coprime integers $(a,b)$ $a\cdot x \equiv 1 \ (mod \ b)$. This can be done in two ways: 1) For the sake of contradiction assume there isn't such an integer. Notice that there are $b$ possible residues $mod$ $b$. Look at the numbers of type $a\cdot i$ $mod$ $b$ where $i=1,2,3...$. Obviously then there exist $i=p,q$ such that $px \equiv qx (mod b)$ or $b|(p-q)x$ or $b|p-q$ but since $p,q<b$ this means $p=q$ contradiction! 2) Pick $x=a^{\\phi{b}-1}$ and we're done. (this requires some more technical knowledge)-->

1) Let $n$ be an odd integer greater than 1 and let $c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n$ be integers. For each permutation $a = (a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n)$ of $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$, define $S(a) = \sum_{i=1}^n c_i a_i$. Prove that there exist permutations $a \neq b$ of $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ such that $n!$ is a divisor of $S(a)-S(b)$. 

2) Let $n$ be positive integer and there are cards $a_1,a_2,...,a_2n$. A perfect mix of cards is an operation which rearranges the order of $a_1,a_2,...,a_2n$ into $a_1,a_{n+1},a_2,a_{n+2},...,a_n,a_{2n}$. Prove that there exist infinitely many $n$ such that after $n$ operations we get the same arrangement as in the beginning at some point.

3)Find all pairs of positive integers $(m,n)$ for which there exist relatively prime integers $a$ and $b$ greater than $1$ such that
$$\frac{a^m+b^m}{a^n+b^n}$$
is an integer. 

4)$n>1$ is odd number. There are numbers $n,n+1,n+2,...,2n-1$ on the blackboard. Prove that we can erase one number, such that the sum of all numbers will be not divided any number on the blackboard.

5) Let $c$ and $n > c$ be positive integers. Mary's teacher writes $n$ positive integers on a blackboard. Is it true that for all $n$ and $c$ Mary can always label the numbers written by the teacher by $a_1,\ldots, a_n$ in such an order that the cyclic product $(a_1-a_2)\cdot(a_2-a_3)\cdots(a_{n-1}-a_n)\cdot(a_n-a_1)$ would be congruent to either $0$ or $c$ modulo $n$?

6) (EGZ Theorem) Prove that from $2n-1$ integer numbers, we can always choose $n$ numbers such that the sum of them is divisible by $n$

8) Let $x$ and $y$ be integers and let $p$ be a prime number. Suppose that there exist realatively prime positive integers $m$ and $n$ such that
$$x^m \equiv y^n \pmod p$$Prove that there exists an unique integer $z$ modulo $p$ such that
$$x \equiv z^n \pmod p \quad \text{and} \quad y \equiv z^m \pmod p$$

9) An $8\times8$ chessboard is completely tiled by $2\times1$ dominoes. Prove that we can place positive integers in all cells of the table in such a way that the sums of numbers in every domino are equal and the numbers placed in two adjacent cells are coprime if and only if they belong to the same domino. (Two cells are called adjacent if they have a common side.)

10) How can we say that $  a^{gcd(m,n)} - 1  $ divides $a^{m} -1 $ or $a^{n} -1 $ while proving gcd($a^{m} -1 $ , $a^{n} -1 $) = $  a^{gcd(m,n)} - 1  $ & we only know that gcd($a^{m} -1 $ , $a^{n} -1 $) divides $  a^{gcd(m,n)} - 1$ ?

11)Prove the expression $\\frac{gcd(n,m)}{n} binom bla bla MONT

12) For all positive integers $n$, denote with $f(n)$ be the smallest positive integer $m$ such that $1+2+...+m$ is divisible by $n$. Find all $n$ such that $f(n)=n-1$
